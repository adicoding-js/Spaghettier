# Spaghettier - Spaghetti-detector

**"Is your code pasta? Or is it perfection?"**

Spaghettier is a VS Code extension that saves you from writing messy, deeply nested code (aka "Spaghetti Code"). It screams at you (sometimes literally) when your indentation gets too deep.

## Features
### 1. 🍝 Visual Alerts
Automatically highlights code lines that are indented too deep. By default, anything deeper than **16 spaces** (4 tabs) gets marked as "Too saucy!". This is customizable.

### 2. 🤬 Gordon Ramsay Mode
Turn this on in settings if you need extra motivation. instead of a polite warning, the extension will roast you with insults like:
* *"IT'S RAW!"*
* *"My grandma codes better than this!"*
* *"Absolute trash!"*

## Requirements

 Still in development😀
